# Socks4 Server

In this project, you are asked to implement the SOCK 4 firewall protocol 
in the application layer of the OSI model.
<br>
SOCKS is similar to a proxy (i.e. intermediary-program)
that acts as both server and client for the purpose of making request 
on behalf of other clients, Because the SOCKS protocol is independent of 
application protocol, it can be used for many different services: telnet, ftp, 
www, etc.
<br>
There are two types of the SOCKS operations (i.e. CONNECT and BIND). You have to
implement both of them.
